# Testyle

This is a work-in-progress stuff. I'm mostly experimenting with node.js, tests and all that stuff. I know I'm doing the stuff that had already been done and inventing a lot of bycicles there, but it won't hurt for me to learn on my own mistakes and play with code just to make sure I understand something.
